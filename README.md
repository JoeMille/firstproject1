## The Coastal Chef Project

This is a website for recruiting temporary chef hire in the Southern English Coastal Region.

## Description

This website was built as a false page for a fictional recruitment company based in the South of England. 
Having been a client for multiple Hospitality Staffing agencies for large restaurants and Hotels, the idea for the 
project was to create a page that quickly communicated it's intent and services without want for further explanation.

The Home Page features a basic landing page with a background image and title, allowing navigation
to the other site pages. 

The About Page contains a few short descriptive paragraphs about the services provided by the fictional Coastal Chef Project.
With there being thousands of potential recruitment agencies catering to the hospitality trade, use of brief and concise text 
rather than long paragraphs filled with boiler plate information on the trade was added.
