# The Coastal Chef Project

![Screenshot](coastal-chef-header-image.png)

This is a website for recruiting temporary chef hire in the Southern English Coastal Region.

## Description

This project was built as a false page for a fictional recruitment company based in the South of England. 
Having been a client for multiple Hospitality Staffing agencies for large restaurants and Hotels, the idea for the 
project was to create a page that quickly communicated it's intent and services without want for further explanation.

Using code from Code Institue challenges and lessons, W3 lessons and examples, and other forum resources, the final site has; 
banner and background images with CSS styling, navigation menus, headers with images, footers with social media and home navigation links.

The biggest challenges faced when creating this site were time-related and technical, such as getting images to fit text boxes, the padding between sections and headers, and ultimately losing work often due to lack of understanding. Starting again from scratch with code saved in external text editors and reworking whilst also doing Code Institute examples of similar errors and problems alongside the milestone project, cleared most roadblocks.

## User Stories

As a chef of over a decade with much experience in navigating overly complex websites for hospitality recruitment, the goals of this website were:

1. Provide an easy to understand platform for contact and service explanation.
2. Have an in built contact form so no need for copying and pasting phone numbers or email addresses.
3. Make the services provided obvious, unecessary complication of a job role makes finding the right candidate a chore.
4. Images and background images that lightly allude to the websites purpose and fit in with the coastal aesthetic.
5. Make sure the location and catchment area of the agency is clealry obvious so as not to invite unwanted traffic.

As a candidate for many hospitality agencies when working free lance and temporary assignment, the main purposes of the Coastal Chef:

1. Write service and job descriptions that are easy to communicate and understand.
2. Make the agency location easily explained so chefs in other parts of the country don't waste time contacting or applying.
3. Deliver an easy to navigate website that people with low computer literacy can click through and engage with.
4. Provide images of fine-dining plates to reinforce a quality standard.
5. Make the contact form non-specific to candidate or employer. 

## Design Choices

The main purpose of the design of the website is to incorporate coastal/nautical aesthetics and provide images/fonts/icons that also embody those themes, as well making it crystal clear that this is a page solely directed towards hospitality candidates and employers.

* The main font used is Square Peg which seemed the best fit due to it's somewhat temprary paint-brush style.
* Images used on the site all maintain a coastal style including the food images.
* Common industry abbreviation is used in the text describing services and about sections.
* A brief history of the owner embodies a pretty typical back story to the majority of industry operated recruitment agencies

## Testing

After my first submission of this project falling short of expectations I began to try and clean up some of the code and re-organising my project, managing to score higher and higher.

The W3c Validator was used to validate the CSS, as well as the HTML. After clearing up some of the highlighted issues in the initial submission the code runs smoothly.

The code beautifying tool from codebeautify.org was used to format the HTML which after comparing the former from latter was a helpful tool in understanding how to better my writing in the future.

The purpose of this site is to provide an easy to navigate format for understanding the company's purpose and being able to contact and engage with them on social media links, which although don't link to any specific social pages function properly.

The Home Page features a basic landing page with a background image and title, allowing navigation
to the other site pages. 

The About Page contains a few short descriptive paragraphs about the services provided by the fictional Coastal Chef Project.
With there being thousands of potential recruitment agencies catering to the hospitality industry, use of brief and concise text 
rather than long paragraphs filled with boiler plate information on the trade was added.

The contact form was borrowed from a w3 Schools lesson on building contact boxes in HTML and CSS alone.

. 
The final product was far from what had been initially planned, having removed much of the unnecessary information from sketches, with much of the planned interactivity being past my understanding at the time of production, the site pages now all engage with their styling and some of the messy writing from first submission has either been altered or removed.

## Summary

When imagining the first submission of my first milestone project, it was far from what was produced. Errors, losing work time and again, not linking stylesheet to html files, poorly chosen images and a poorly written README file as well as countless others were ample obstacles to try and overcome. Although far from what I had imagined, I'm entirely thankful to the process for highlighting just how difficult even basic web design is. From all shortcomings, errors and oversights it's shone a light on what attributes of development I'd like to become far more proficient at, and also helped me realise that if I can work as hard at development as I had to work learning to perform in my current professional domain, that I will have ample fuel to jump into this next chapter of my professional life well-equipped.
