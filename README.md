## The Coastal Chef Project

This is a website for recruiting temporary chef hire in the Southern English Coastal Region.

## Description

This website was built as a false page for a fictional recruitment company based in the South of England. 
Having been a client for multiple Hospitality Staffing agencies for large restaurants and Hotels, the idea for the 
project was to create a page that quickly communicated it's intent and services without want for further explanation.

The Home Page features a basic landing page with a background image and title, allowing navigation
to the other site pages. 

The About Page contains a few short descriptive paragraphs about the services provided by the fictional Coastal Chef Project.
With there being thousands of potential recruitment agencies catering to the hospitality industry, use of brief and concise text 
rather than long paragraphs filled with boiler plate information on the trade was added. 

Using code from Code Institue challenges and lessons, W3 lessons and examples, and other forum resources, the final site has; 
banner and background images with CSS styling, navigation menus, headers with images, footers with social media and home navigation links.

Encountered many confusing fundamental mistakes all the way through the process, having to often go back over previous course material to help identify where the project was going wrong. The most basic of errors was having a less than thorough understanding of commiting work and struggling to do so effectively until reaching the final stages of site editing.

The biggest challenges faced when creating this site were time-related and technical, such as getting images to fit text boxes, the padding between sections and headers, and ultimately losing work often due to lack of understanding of commit messages and using Git Templates. Starting again from scratch with code saved in external text editors and reworking whilst also doing Code Institute examples of similar errors and problems alongside the milestone project, cleared most roadblocks. Moving forward adding more interactive content, sounds and video as well as creating contact forms and menu items more clearly and consistently is priority as well as repeating exercises and problems faced throughout the process to achieve a better understanding of HTML & CSS. 

After my first submission of this project falling short of expectations I began to try and clean up some of the code, as per my assessor's helpful advice I started by using Google Lighthouse developer tool and after re-organising my project managed to score higher and higher.

The purpose of this site is to provide an easy to navigate format for understanding the company's purpose and being able to contact and the engage with on social media links, which although don't link to any specific social pages, now work thanks to errors highlighted in my first submission. The contact form on the Contact page is now styled and although not perfect by  any means, finally links to style sheets as intended.
